# DataModels
JSON schema models and generated code to validate and handle various data in PocketMine-MP

This library uses [php-json-schema-model-generator](https://github.com/wol-soft/php-json-schema-model-generator) to generate code used for fast non-reflective handling of various YAML and JSON data in PocketMine-MP.

At the time of writing, this includes models for the following:
- `plugin_list.yml`
- `server.properties`
- `pocketmine.yml`
- `plugin.yml` in plugins
